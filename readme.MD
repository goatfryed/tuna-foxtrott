Educational project about mobx, typescript and sass, and other web technologies I want to try out.

## Development
I use storybook to develop component wise. In a rough way, it can be used as an editor/preview for creating adventures to play.

I want to create a custom storybook plugin to further exploit the usage of it as an adventure editor.
We'll see how that goes.
